Title: Soft Copy

Description:

A double self-portrait offers some clues to Muriel Cooper’s thinking around
human-computer interface design. This composite picture registers at least
three different photographic times and as many imaging feedback loops. It’s a
layered image on its surface, and baroque in its construction; the picture was
assembled over 10 years, beginning around 1974. Around that time, Cooper
wrote a bio which laid out her interests: “… beginnings and process. More with
change and technology and their meanings to human communication than with
rigorous graphic design theory and style.”
